# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Engineers can see exactly what their UHF RFID reader is transmitting -- decoded EPC Gen2 commands with timing, raw bits, and RF visualization -- without expensive dedicated test equipment.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-hardware-connection

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-hardware-connection) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 4 phases following strict dependency chain: hardware -> visualization -> decoding -> timeline
- [Research]: Three-worker architecture (USB Worker, DSP Worker, Main Thread) must be established in Phase 1 -- cannot be retrofitted
- [Research]: Custom C/Emscripten WASM required for EPC Gen2 PIE demodulation -- no existing library; JS too slow for 2.4 MSPS
- [Phase 01]: Removed vite-plugin-top-level-await -- incompatible with Vite 8 Rolldown; native support in Vite 8
- [Phase 01]: Used Svelte 5 $props() with @render children() instead of deprecated slot syntax
- [Phase 01]: Used RTL2832U.open() directly instead of RTL2832U_Provider for worker-compatible WebUSB pattern
- [Phase 01]: Ring buffer created per capture session in USB Worker, not at init -- allows clean state per session
- [Phase 01]: MessageChannel for direct USB-to-DSP worker communication -- bypasses main thread for IQ data

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Verify @jtarrio/webrtlsdr npm published version matches GitHub source before committing to it
- [Research]: Verify SvelteKit 2 / Vite compatibility (Vite 8 Rolldown may have issues)
- [Research]: Phase 3 is highest technical risk -- no prior art for browser-based EPC Gen2 PIE demod in WASM
